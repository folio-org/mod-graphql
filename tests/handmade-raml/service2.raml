#%RAML 1.0
title: Second of several RAMLs that use a person schema

# Uses the same schema (basic-person.json) as service1, named with a
# different RAML type name ("basicPerson" instead of "person"). The
# two services are compatible because the two definitions are of
# different types (and also because they are identical anyway).

types:
  basicPerson: !include basic-person.json
